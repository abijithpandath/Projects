# üè† Real Estate Price Prediction Web Application

## ‚≠ê Situation
In the competitive real estate market, accurate property price predictions are essential for buyers, sellers, and investors to make informed decisions. There was a need to develop an end-to-end solution that not only built a sophisticated predictive model but also provided an accessible and user-friendly web interface. This project was designed to address the need for accurate real estate price forecasting in Bangalore, making it easier for non-technical users to access and utilize these predictions.

## üéØ Task
The primary objective was to design and implement a comprehensive machine learning solution for predicting real estate prices. This involved creating a reliable predictive model, developing a scalable backend to handle predictions, and building an intuitive user interface. The goal was to demonstrate the ability to translate advanced data science concepts into a practical, deployable application.

## üîß Action
To achieve these goals, the following actions were undertaken:

- **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:**
  - Sourced the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle.
  - Used **Python**, **Numpy**, and **Pandas** to clean the data, including handling missing values, removing outliers, and performing feature engineering.

- **Model Development:**
  - Developed a **Linear Regression** model using **Sklearn**.
  - Applied **dimensionality reduction** and **hyperparameter tuning** with **GridSearchCV**.
  - Validated the model using **k-fold cross-validation** to ensure robustness.

- **Backend Development:**
  - Built a **Python Flask** server to handle HTTP requests and serve predictions based on user input.

- **Frontend Development:**
  - Designed and implemented a responsive web interface using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
  - Enabled users to input property features like square footage and number of bedrooms, and retrieve price predictions from the Flask server.

- **System Integration and Testing:**
  - Integrated all components into a cohesive system.
  - Conducted extensive testing to validate prediction accuracy and ensure a smooth user experience.

## üéâ Result
The project successfully delivered a fully functional real estate price prediction web application. The model demonstrated high accuracy, while the backend efficiently handled user requests with minimal latency. The user-friendly interface made complex data insights accessible to a wide audience, enabling users to make informed decisions based on property features. This project highlighted my expertise in data science, machine learning, and full-stack development, showcasing my ability to manage and deliver a complete, deployable solution.
