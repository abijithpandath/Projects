## Project Description: Beetle Game Using Python Fundamentals

### ⭐ Situation
I aimed to demonstrate my foundational knowledge of Python programming and control structures by developing an interactive game. The project needed to illustrate key programming concepts while engaging users in a fun activity.

### 🎯 Task
The task was to design and implement a game that effectively uses Python's control structures to manage game logic. The game should simulate randomness, involve user interaction, and ensure a logical game flow using loops and conditionals.

### 🔧 Action
The action plan included:
1. Using the `randint` function from the `random` module to simulate dice rolls.
2. Encapsulating game logic within a function to manage beetle part collection.
3. Employing loops and conditionals to control the game flow.
4. Creating a simple text-based user interface for player interaction.

### 🎉 Result
The Beetle Game successfully showcased the practical application of Python control structures, providing a fun and interactive way to illustrate fundamental programming concepts through a completed game where players collected all beetle parts.
