# Beetle Game Using Python Fundamentals
- I aimed to demonstrate my foundational knowledge of Python programming and control structures by developing an interactive game. The project needed to illustrate key programming concepts while engaging users in a fun activity.
- The task was to design and implement a game that effectively uses Python's control structures to manage game logic. The game should simulate randomness, involve user interaction, and ensure a logical game flow using loops and conditionals.
- The action plan includes the use randint function from the random module to simulate dice rolls, encapsulated game logic within a function to manage beetle part collection and employed loops and conditionals to control the game flow. Additionally, I created a simple text-based user interface for player interaction.
- The Beetle Game successfully showcased the practical application of Python control structures, providing a fun and interactive way to illustrate fundamental programming concepts through a completed game where players collected all beetle parts.
