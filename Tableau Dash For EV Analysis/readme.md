# 🚗 Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Dashboard

## 📍 Situation:
With the increasing shift towards sustainable transportation, understanding the adoption trends of electric vehicles (EVs) has become crucial for automotive companies, policymakers, and environmentalists. The challenge was to analyze a large dataset of electric vehicles across various states in the U.S., focusing on different metrics such as vehicle types, model years, and geographic distribution to provide actionable insights.

## 🎯 Task:
The objective was to design an interactive and comprehensive Tableau dashboard that not only visualizes key metrics related to electric vehicles but also allows stakeholders to drill down into specific data, such as CAFV (Clean Air Vehicle) eligibility, EV type (BEV/PHEV), model, and state. The goal was to create a tool that could aid in strategic decision-making by presenting the data in an easily interpretable format.

## 🛠️ Action:
- **Data Preparation:** Cleaned and organized the raw dataset to ensure accuracy and relevance of the data points.
- **Dashboard Design:** Developed an intuitive Tableau dashboard incorporating various visualizations:
  - **KPI Tiles:** Highlighted essential metrics such as Total Vehicles, Average Electric Range, Total BEV Vehicles, and Total PHEV Vehicles.
  - **Line Chart:** Illustrated trends over time with a line chart showing Total Vehicles by Model Year.
  - **Map Visualization:** Created a choropleth map to visualize the geographic distribution of EVs across U.S. states.
  - **Bar Chart:** Analyzed the market share by showcasing the Top 10 Vehicle Makes based on total vehicle count.
  - **Donut/Pie Chart:** Demonstrated the distribution of vehicles by CAFV eligibility status.
  - **Table:** Provided detailed insights into vehicle models, making, EV type, and their contribution to the total dataset.
- **Interactivity:** Implemented filters for CAFV Eligibility, EV Type, Model, and State to allow users to customize their view of the data.
- **Visual Aesthetics:** Applied consistent color coding and layout to enhance the dashboard’s readability and user experience.

## 🏆 Result:
The final Tableau dashboard provided a powerful, interactive tool that enabled stakeholders to quickly identify key trends and insights into the electric vehicle market. The dashboard facilitated data-driven decision-making, helping organizations optimize their strategies for EV adoption and policy-making. The project demonstrated my ability to handle large datasets, utilize advanced Tableau functionalities, and deliver visually compelling and functional data visualizations that support business objectives.
