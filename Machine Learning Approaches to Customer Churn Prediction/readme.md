# Customer Churn Analysis
- The goal was to develop a predictive model that could identify customers at risk of leaving, thereby enabling the company to implement targeted retention strategies.
- The task required a comprehensive approach involving data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to ensure robust and actionable results.
- The action plan handled duplicate entries, addressed missing values, renamed columns for clarity, detected and treated outliers, and removed irrelevant columns to prepare the data for modelling.
- Successfully evaluated the performance of each model using various metrics and visualized the prediction findings. This step involved using Python and machine learning libraries to ensure accurate and interpretable results.
